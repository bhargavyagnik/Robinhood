# Robinhood
Robinhood is an android app to share your old clothes to poor people by just giving the details of your old clothes. This app provides a platform for NGO's to share and recieve donations for clothes

In our daily life we wear clothes and they get old we probably throw them or give  them to our servants.
So suppose the person you may give may not be able to fit in the clothes , its a problem so what our app does is gets this clothes from poor and then delivers to the NGo which may send them to the best fit. In a way it reduces the problem of misfit and also it porvides a larger audience for the clothes
